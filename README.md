This repository uses a machine learning algorithm to detect the sky conditions of RAO AllSky images and extract the date, time, and serial number of those images on clear nights. 

The hope is to reference the dates of clear nights with the SQM.

The two folders are pretrained machine-learning models that are loaded into the scripts. This is lightweight and should run smoothly. If you would like to see the training process or train models yourself, please contact me (Zach Sumners).
